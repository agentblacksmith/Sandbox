Chapter 6

As Simba continued to lead his pride, he began to realize that there was more to leadership than just protecting his own. He had a responsibility to the entire savannah, to ensure that all animals could thrive in harmony.

Simba began to seek out other prides, and soon he was meeting with other lion kings to discuss ways to improve the savannah's ecosystem. Together they created a plan to manage the hunting grounds, to ensure that there was enough prey for all animals, and to protect the environment from damage caused by overgrazing.

As he looked out over the savannah, Simba felt a sense of pride in what they had accomplished. He realized that true leadership wasn't just about protecting his own pride, but about working together to create a better world for everyone.
