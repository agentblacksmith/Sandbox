Once upon a time, in a dense forest, a baby elephant named Ellie was separated from her family. She cried out for help, but there was no one around to hear her.

As night began to fall, Ellie grew more and more frightened. She didn't know what to do or where to go. Just then, a panther named Kali appeared from the shadows.

Ellie was terrified of Kali at first, but the panther reassured her that she was there to help. Kali knew the forest like the back of her paw and promised to guide Ellie back to her family.

Over the next few days, Kali led Ellie through the dense forest, helping her to navigate the terrain and find food and water. Ellie began to trust Kali and even enjoyed her company.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity, Ellie and Kali arrived at the edge of the forest. Ellie's family was waiting for her, trumpeting with joy at her return.

Ellie turned to Kali, tears in her eyes, and thanked her for all that she had done. Kali simply nodded and disappeared back into the forest.

From that day on, Ellie never forgot the kindness of the panther who had helped her find her way home. And whenever she saw Kali in the forest, she would trumpet with joy, remembering the friendship that had brought her back to her family.
