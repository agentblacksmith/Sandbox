Chapter 11

As Kion continued his journey, he found himself drawn to a distant mountain range, where a great danger was said to lurk. The local animals told stories of a fierce dragon that lived in the mountains, terrorizing the nearby villages and hoarding vast treasures.

Kion knew that he could not ignore such a threat. He set out for the mountains, determined to confront the dragon and put an end to its reign of terror.
