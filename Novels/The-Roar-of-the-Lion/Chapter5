Chapter 5

Despite the new hunting ground, the savannah remained a challenging place to live. Simba knew that there were other prides in the area, and he had to remain vigilant to protect his own. He sent out scouts to keep watch for any signs of danger and made sure his pride was always prepared to defend themselves.

But even with all his efforts, Simba couldn't prevent all threats. One day, a pack of wild dogs attacked the pride, and Simba fought fiercely to protect his family. The battle was fierce, but in the end, Simba emerged victorious.

As he tended to the wounded members of his pride, Simba couldn't help but think about the price of leadership. He knew that the safety of his pride would always be his top priority, even if it meant putting himself in danger.
